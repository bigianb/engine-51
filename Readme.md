# What is this?

Some tooling to work with the Area 51 game from 2005.
Very experimental.

# How to build

Install Qt 6 and run cmake. Nothing special - works in a vscode cmake environment just fine.

Github actions build for winodws, linux and macos so you can always look at the workflow there to troubleshoot any issues you see locally.

# Tools

## DFSViewer
Drag/Drop a DFS file onto the app. Left splitter panel will show contents and file sizes. Click a filename to see a preview in the right hand panel.
In the right hand pane switch between a text description and a 3d view (not yet implemented)
