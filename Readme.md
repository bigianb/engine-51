# What is this?

Some tooling to work with the Area 51 game from 2005.
Very experimental.

# How to build

Install Qt 6 and run cmake. Nothing special - works in a vscode cmake environment just fine.

Github actions build for winodws, linux and macos so you can always look at the workflow there to troubleshoot any issues you see locally.
